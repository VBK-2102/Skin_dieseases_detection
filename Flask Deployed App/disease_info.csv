0,Acne ,"Acne is a common skin condition that happens when hair follicles under the skin become clogged.
Scab is caused by a fungus that infects both leaves and fruit.
Scabby fruit are often unfit for eating.
Infected leaves have olive green to brown spots.
Leaves with many leaf spots turn yellow and fall off early.
Leaf loss weakens the tree when it occurs many years in a row.
Planting disease resistant varieties is the best way to manage scab.","Keep your skin clean: Wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and bacteria.
Use acne treatments: Apply over-the-counter products containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to help kill bacteria, dry up pimples, and reduce inflammation.
Exfoliate regularly: Use a gentle exfoliating scrub or a chemical exfoliant containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) one to three times a week to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores.
Use a moisturizer: Apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to help reduce inflammation and prevent dryness.
Avoid picking or popping pimples: Resist the temptation to pick or pop pimples, as this can lead to further inflammation, scarring, and prolonged healing time.
Consider prescription treatments: Consult a dermatologist for prescription-strength treatments such as antibiotics, retinoids, or hormonal therapies if your acne is severe or persistent.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/08/26/10/10/47_cysticacne-8col.jpg

Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.
Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.

Topical Creams and Gels: Applying creams or gels containing medications like fluorouracil, imiquimod, or ingenol mebutate to treat AK lesions.
Photodynamic Therapy (PDT): Using a light-sensitive medication and specific wavelengths of light to destroy abnormal cells.
